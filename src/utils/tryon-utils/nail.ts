 * Real nails are only visible when (a) the back of the hand actually faces the camera (not the
 * palm, and not turned so far to the side that the nail is seen edge-on), and (b) the finger in
 * question is actually there to have a nail on. `HandLandmarker`'s 21-point skeleton alone can't
 * tell either of these apart from a normal, fully-present, camera-facing hand - it always predicts
 * the same fixed 21 points, plausibly placed, whether the palm or the back faces the camera, and
 * whether every finger is genuinely present or not. Both checks below key off
 * `HandLandmarkerResult.worldLandmarks` (real-world-scale 3D coordinates, not the normalized
 * `landmarks` used for on-screen drawing) - a per-landmark `visibility`/`presence` score would
 * have been the more direct signal, but MediaPipe's own issue tracker confirms `HandLandmarker`
 * never populates it meaningfully (always reads back as 0), so this reasons from 3D geometry
 * instead.
