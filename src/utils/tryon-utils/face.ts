// utils already established in this app (landmark-driven clip paths, native `ctx.filter` for
// blur rather than a manual multi-sample kernel).
//
// Deliberately landmark-only - an earlier version of this file also tried to detect and erase
// hair/beard/mustache from the tint using a pixel-color heuristic (sampling the source frame to
// guess "skin" vs "not skin" by luminance/saturation). That was dropped: a color-only guess has
// no real way to tell dark hair from dark *skin*, so any threshold that catches hair reliably
// also risks misreading a deeper skin tone as hair near the face's edges - a fairness problem,
// not just a tuning one. Instead, the upload/live instructions screen (see
// `FACE_UPLOAD_INSTRUCTIONS`/`FACE_LIVE_INSTRUCTIONS` in constants/tryon-constants/face.ts)
// tells the shopper up front to keep hair off their face - the same "set the shopper up for a
// good frame" approach already used there for lighting/framing/no-sunglasses, rather than
// trying to algorithmically fix a bad frame after the fact.

 * clip, eyes/eyebrows/mouth punched out), but the chosen shade gets warmed first so it reads as
 * a sun-kissed bronze glow rather than a neutral color-match wash - the same "make it read as
 * the real cosmetic effect, not just a colored patch" reasoning HIGHLIGHTER's whitening and
 * CONTOUR's darkening already established for the localized finishes.

/* ================= BB CREAM ================================================================
 * Sheer full-face wash - same `fillFaceOvalRegion` full-face wash FOUNDATION/BRONZER use, no
 * color-mix transform at all (unlike HIGHLIGHTER's whitening or BRONZER's warm-shift), because
 * "BB cream" isn't a different hue effect - FACE.md describes it as literally "lighter than
 * foundation". That's an alpha concern, not a color one, so the only difference from
 * `applyFoundationFace` is baking in `BBCREAM_BASE_ALPHA` (0.35) instead of FOUNDATION's fixed
 * 0.6 base opacity - see `BBCREAM_BASE_ALPHA`'s own comment for why this is baked into the render
 * itself rather than relying purely on `FACE_RANGE_BOUNDS.BBCREAM`'s lower ceiling.
