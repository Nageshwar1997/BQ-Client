// type already forces every one of those 6 finishes to have a complete entry at compile time -
// a missing key is a type error, not something a runtime test needs to catch. What the type
// system *can't* catch is a value that's the wrong number for what it means - e.g. an opacity
// typo'd as `3` instead of `0.3`. That's what these tests are for.
