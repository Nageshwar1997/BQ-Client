// Intensity-slider bounds, one entry per finish (maps to engine state's `range`, i.e. how
// strongly the finish's texture/filter pass shows through - see utils/tryon-utils/lip.ts).
// Previously this was a single bounds object shared by every finish, collapsed down from the
// reference's own per-type `getRangeValues` (which genuinely differs per finish there - matte/
// glossy/shimmer/crayon each had their own numbers). That collapsing was a real problem: a
// slider position that read as "medium" on MATTE could read as way too strong or barely-there on
// a finish with a different natural intensity curve, since every finish shared one min/max/
// default regardless. Split back out below - MATTE/GLOSS/SHIMMER/CRAYON are the reference's own
// validated numbers, ported as-is (unchanged from before). The other 7 finishes have no
// reference equivalent, so each reuses the bounds of whichever finish its own rendering is
// closest to (see utils/tryon-utils/lip.ts's own per-finish comments for exactly how each is
// built) rather than inventing unrelated numbers:
//  - SATIN's fill is literally `applyMatteLips` underneath -> MATTE's bounds.
//  - BALM/PLUMPER/OIL/METALLIC are all built on the same `applyTexturedLips` composite GLOSS
//    uses -> GLOSS's bounds (each finish's own visual difference from GLOSS comes from its
//    `TEXTURED_FINISH_TUNING` entry's opacities, not from a different raw alpha range).
//  - STAIN's own fill function already hard-caps its effective alpha (`Math.min(alpha, 0.35)`
//    in `applyStainLips`) - its slider bounds match that cap exactly, so there's no dead zone
//    where moving the slider past a point does nothing.
//  - LINER isn't a fill at all (a stroke - see `applyLinerLips`), so it reuses the reference's
//    own Eyeliner/Kajal bounds instead of any lip-fill finish's - a stroke's "how solid the line
//    reads" is a much closer match to those than to how a lip fill blends.
