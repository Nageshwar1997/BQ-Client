 * Shown before a shopper picks/takes a photo - see `getTryOnInstructions` in `./index` for why
 * these are independent per category. HAIR's own real constraint: the segmentation model reads
 * hair from the photo/frame's own pixels (no landmark ring to fall back on), so anything that
 * obscures or disguises where the hair actually is - a hat, a hood, hair tucked out of frame -
 * genuinely breaks detection in a way FACE/LIP/EYE's landmark tracking doesn't have to worry about.
