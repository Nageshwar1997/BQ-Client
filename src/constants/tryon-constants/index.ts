/* ================= PER-CATEGORY INSTRUCTIONS ==================================================
 * Shown before a shopper picks/takes a photo - in the sidebar's compact popover and the full
 * instructions screen - so they know what makes a tryon actually work well, before finding out
 * after a bad shot/frame gives a bad result.
 *
 * Deliberately one full, independent list per category (defined in that category's own file -
 * `./lip.ts`'s `LIP_UPLOAD_INSTRUCTIONS`/`LIP_LIVE_INSTRUCTIONS`, `./face.ts`'s equivalents)
 * rather than a shared base list every category extends: each category's own tryon pipeline has
 * its own real constraints, and those don't generalize. FACE's full-face fill genuinely breaks
 * on a turned head or hair falling across the forehead in a way LIP's lip-only region never has
 * to care about; a future NAIL flow wouldn't need "face" advice at all. A shared base would
 * either miss a category's actual gotchas or hand every other category advice that doesn't apply
 * to it. Independent lists do mean the handful of genuinely universal tips (lighting, focus) get
 * repeated per category - a fine trade for each list staying accurate and independently
 * editable, matching how this app already keeps everything else category-specific in its own
 * place (separate engine classes, separate landmark-constants files, etc. per category).
 *
 * This file only wires those category-owned lists together into one lookup - it doesn't define
 * any instruction text itself.
