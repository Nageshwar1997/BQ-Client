// itself, the joint right before it is `DIP` for the four fingers or `IP` for the thumb (the thumb
// has one fewer joint than the others). A nail plate has no dedicated landmark of its own - every
// NAIL render function approximates its shape from the [nearJoint, tip] pair (see
// `NAIL_START_RATIO`/`NAIL_END_RATIO`/`NAIL_WIDTH_RATIO` below), the same "real landmark +
// geometric approximation" technique `FACE_OVAL_INDICES`'s own forehead extension or
// `CONCEALER_BLOB_WIDTH_RATIO`'s under-eye anchor already use elsewhere in this app. `mcp` is only
// used for the finger-presence check (`isFingerPresent`, utils/tryon-utils/nail.ts) - a missing or

// world-landmark axis conventions aren't something to guess blindly, so this was calibrated
// against a real photo rather than assumed: a known-correct back-of-hand-facing-camera reference

// a genuine back-of-hand photo read as "facing the camera" per `NAIL_ORIENTATION_MIN_Z_RATIO`
// below.
//
// IMPORTANT - this calibration is Left-hand-specific: the reference photo's own detected
// `handedness` was "Left". Hands are chiral (mirror images of each other), so the exact same
// physical "back facing camera" pose produces an OPPOSITE-signed z-component for a Right hand -
// confirmed with real data, not assumed: the same reference photo horizontally flipped (a genuine
// mirror-image pose, detected as "Right") produced a raw z-ratio of *+0.80*, the opposite sign for
// the identical physical orientation. A single fixed sign can only ever be correct for one
