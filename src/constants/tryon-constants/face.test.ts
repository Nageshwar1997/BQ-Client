// Same reasoning as constants/tryon-constants/lip.test.ts's identical suite, against FACE's own
// mouth-exclusion ring - `MOUTH_OUTER_CONTOUR_INDICES` is genuinely *derived* at module-load time
// (see its own comment, ./face.ts) from `MOUTH_UPPER_OUTER_ARC`/`MOUTH_LOWER_OUTER_ARC` via the
// exact same "outer arc forward, then the other reversed" formula LIP's own
// `LIP_OUTER_CONTOUR_INDICES` uses - not hand-transcribed, so nothing here re-derives it with that
// same formula (a recomputed comparison would trivially match even if the source arcs changed
// underneath it). This anchors the actual numbers instead, so an accidental edit to either source
// arc - or to the derivation itself - shows up as a real diff.
//
// `MOUTH_UPPER_OUTER_ARC`/`MOUTH_LOWER_OUTER_ARC` themselves stay unexported (only
// `MOUTH_OUTER_CONTOUR_INDICES` is public - nothing else needs the two raw arcs) - the corner
// landmarks (61 = left mouth corner, 291 = right) are hardcoded below rather than importing them,
// same stable, publicly-documented MediaPipe ids LIP's own arrays are built from (LIP's
// `UPPER_LIP_INDICES`/`LOWER_LIP_INDICES` start/end on the exact same two ids).
