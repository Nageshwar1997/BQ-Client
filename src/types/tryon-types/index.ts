// render functions. Object params make the call site self-documenting (`applyBlushFace({ face,
// ctx, rgb, dimension, alpha })` vs remembering positional order) and let a category extend this
// with just its own additional field(s) - see `IFaceRenderParams` (types/tryon-types/face.ts) and
// `ILipRenderParams`/`ILipSingleTextureRenderParams`/`ILipDoubleTextureRenderParams`
// (types/tryon-types/lip.ts). Purely the render-function boundary - `FaceLandmarkerEngineBase.applyEffect`
// itself (one level up, also carries engine-only concerns like `state`/`assets`) has its own
// wider shape, `IApplyEffectParams` below. Internal, single-file-only helpers (e.g.
// `drawFeatheredBlob`/`fillFaceOvalRegion` in utils/tryon-utils/face.ts) deliberately stay

// them, `state.range` is the actual intensity value at this level, `alpha` only gets derived from
// it inside each category's own `applyEffect` override). Still category-agnostic (generic over
// `TState`/`TAssets`, mirroring the class itself), but carries the engine's own raw `rgb` (every
// category receives the same `TRGBTuple` here; what each category's *render functions* actually
// want - raw `rgb` for FACE, a pre-built `color` string for LIP - is each category's own

// frame while Live mode keeps running. What's actually being detected depends on the category:
// LIP/FACE/EYE track a real face, HAIR tracks a hair-confidence mask (`getHairDetectionStatus`),
// NAIL tracks a hand (`getHandDetectionStatus`) - the status values below are phrased generically
// so every category's own detection function can report them meaningfully.
// 'not-in-frame': nothing detected at all, or it's partially cut off by the frame edge.
// 'not-clear': something is detected and fully inside the frame, but too small to trust (too far
// from the camera, or - by the same "too little is confidently visible" reasoning - too
// obscured/blurry in practice). Only ever produced by FACE today (see `isFaceTurnedTooMuch`'s
// neighboring checks in utils/tryon-utils/face.ts) - HAIR/NAIL have no equivalent "too small to
// trust" concept.
// 'turned': something is detected, in frame, and large enough, but oriented wrong - only ever
// produced by categories whose rendering genuinely needs a specific pose (see
// `FaceLandmarkerEngineBase.refineDetectionStatus`/`FaceEngineBase`'s override for FACE's "head turned too
// far to one side", and `getHandDetectionStatus`, utils/tryon-utils/nail.ts, for NAIL's "hand not
// facing the camera nail-side-up"); a category that never produces this value can never report it.
