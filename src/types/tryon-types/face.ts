// `desaturateTowardGray`) before they can paint - unlike LIP, where every finish only ever
// consumes the shade as a flat string (see `ILipRenderParams`, types/tryon-types/lip.ts). All 8
// FACE finishes share this exact shape, including FOUNDATION - it used to be the one exception
// (took a pre-built `color: string` while every other finish took `rgb`), unified here since
// there was no real reason for it to differ.
