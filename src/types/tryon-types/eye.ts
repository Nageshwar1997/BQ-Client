// EYE-specific extension rather than touching the shared base - `null` until the shopper picks
// one, same "blank until chosen" shape `color`/`type` already use. The actual set of valid ids
// differs per finish (EYELINER's 7 aren't KAJAL's 4) - see `EYELINER_PATTERNS` in
// constants/tryon-constants/eye.ts - so this stays a plain `string` rather than one shared union.

// have entirely different pattern sets - each render function narrows/switches on its own
// finish-specific union internally instead.
